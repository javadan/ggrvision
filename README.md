# ggrvision

## Earlier Gallus Gallus Roboticus vision code 

[mirandamoss.com/gallusgallusroboticus](https://mirandamoss.com/gallusgallusroboticus)

TF1 Keras training, resulting in a successful U-Net (binary) "chicken-vision", and an unsuccessful simulation-trained vision using RGB for the 3 classes, chicken, egg, robot.  Results are pretty, arty, but not practical.

Was going to use the U-Net to try __in ovo__ sex detection, but calcium deposits on the eggs made it impossible.
